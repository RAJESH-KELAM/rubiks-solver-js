# Rubik's Cube Solver (JS)

## Overview
Simple JavaScript-based Rubik's Cube solver. OOP cube representation, basic move logic, random shuffle, and reversal-based solving algorithm. Visualization uses `getCubeSvg()` stub.

## Files
- `index.html` — Entry point with rendering & controls.
- `cube.js` — Core logic: `RubiksCube` class.
- (Optional) Implement UI controls in future.

## Usage
1. Clone/download project.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click "Shuffle" to scramble.
4. Click "Solve" to run reversal-based solving.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement full face moves (`R, U, D, L, B`).
- Replace solve logic with beginner method.
- Add step-by-step UI navigation.
